The Multiple Disease Prediction WebApp is an interactive application built using Streamlit, a versatile Python library, designed to provide users with quick and accurate predictions for Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The web application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to input relevant health data easily and receive immediate predictions regarding their health status. The app ensures precise predictions by leveraging machine learning models trained on comprehensive datasets sourced from Kaggle. These models are preserved using Pickle for efficient loading and deployment. The model's prediction accuracy is 85% for Heart Disease, 80% for Diabetes, and 87% for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. Developed using Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, the project exemplifies robust and efficient development practices. The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud, providing reliable and accessible service to users. This project highlights the power of machine learning and user-centric design, offering a practical tool for early disease detection and proactive health management.

### Netflix Recommendation System
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

The Netflix Recommendation System project leverages the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) technique from Machine Learning to create an advanced recommendation system. SVD, a matrix factorization method, is essential in collaborative filtering-based systems to predict user ratings for movies. The project's workflow included dedicating 80% of the time to data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), with the remaining 20% focused on building a predictive model and retrieving data as specified in the problem statement. By analyzing a dataset with over 2 crore records, the recommendation system successfully identifies the most popular and liked genres among users.

### Walmart Sales Forecasting

The Walmart Sales Forecasting project employs ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) techniques to model and forecast time series data for future sales. By incorporating seasonal patterns, SARIMA enhances prediction accuracy. The project dedicated 90% of its time to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization, identifying trends and anomalies in historical sales data. As a result, it achieved a notable reduction in forecast error rates and provided actionable insights that optimized sales strategies and promotional planning.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
.
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project employs advanced machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions effectively. By utilizing various models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM), the system predicts the likelihood of fraud based on transaction data. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover hidden patterns and anomalies, ensuring a robust understanding of the dataset. The project focuses on creating a highly accurate prediction model, achieving significant success in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Ultimately, this project enhances security measures for credit card transactions, providing peace of mind to users and financial institutions.
